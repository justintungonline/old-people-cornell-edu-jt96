	<h3>Introduction to Southeast Asia: Gender Regulation in the Dutch East 
	  Indies, c. 19th and 20th Centuries</h3>
	
	<span class="f_blue">Abstract :</span>

	<p>
	  The development of immigration, social, and sexual regulations between men 
	  and women administered by the VOC and later Dutch government was not planned
	  nor linear relative to certain other spheres of government interest. It 
	  experienced many modifications and corrections before it reached a more final
	  form in the early 1900s. The government regulated many parts of gender and
	  familial relations from marriage, immigration, children, domestic life, etc.
	  This changing set of regulations was due to government responses to social 
	  pressures, modernization, efficiency, and organized society based on European 
	  ideals. These factors eventually produced a set of more liberal regulations 
	  like those existing during the colony's early history. To discount the process 
	  as having little affect in the end would be incorrect since the government 
	  genuinely had to modify its regulations initially to achieve the kind of 
	  "civilized" society it wanted to portray to the natives and to manage a society 
	  based on the ideas of European colonialism. In addition, from an economic and
	  political perspective, during the 1800s such revisions and changes of policies 
	  were necessary in molding a colonial society corresponding to its state of 
	  economic progress as viewed by the Dutch government in Batavia and upholding 
	  a sense of European prestige in the East Indies. The course of development of 
	  gender relations was controlled by the colonial government and reflected 
	  government policy. The essay recounts the revising of regulatory codes in gender
	  relations chronologically from the ban on female immigration in the mid 1900s,
	  to the promotion of concubinage, and finally the policy of European marriage and 
	  promotion of a strong European society in the East Indies in the late 19th and 
	  20th centuries.

	<h2>Influence of Political Goals on Gender Regulation in the Dutch East Indies</h2>

	<p>
	  Dutch colonialism in Southeast Asia beginning in the 19th century had two 
	  main driving factors: political and economic power. Although these and othe
	  factors affected the process of gender regulation in the Dutch East Indies,
	  the policies of the Dutch colonial government regarding this issue show that
	  political goals were the predominant force in governing European male relationships
	  with either native or European women. By gender regulation what is meant is the
	  governing of the sexual, conjugal, and domestic lives of Europeans and
	  specifically European men. These political goals often conformed to economic
	  or religious ideologies, but major changes in gender regulation had the primary
	  purpose of satisfying political ends. These ends were those for the furthering
	  of colonial power in the Dutch East Indies through the control of population
	  (both native and European), fulfilling the "civilizing mission", and the expansion
	  and assertion of Dutch power over the Netherlands East Indies (Loos). 
	  examination of the process of colonial government policies concerning gender
	  regulation and how they changed results in two main time periods, that of the
	  mid to late 19th century when native concubines were emphasized and that of the
	  early 20th century when marriage between Europeans was promoted and concubines
	  discouraged. However, before understanding what happened during this period and
	  how the Dutch colonial government policies changed in the 20th century, the 
	  political goals of the government during the 19th century must be examined.
	</p>
	<p>
	  During the 19th century, the Dutch colonial government like other European
	  colonial governments in Southeast Asia executed their plans to civilize and
	  modernize the region. The ideology held by these governments was that there
	  was single evolutionary path to modernity and Europe was at the highest 
	  point of human development (Loos). Because of this view, which matched with
	  concepts of imperialism and colonialism, the colonial government felt it 
	  necessary to portray the superior elements of European society to the natives
	  and clearly delineate the separation between the colonizer and the colonized
	  (McClintock et al. 348). The ability to achieve these political goals was due
	  to the colonial authoritarianism that existed in the Dutch East Indies
	  throughout most of the colony's history (Taylor 7). In her essay 
	  "Making Empire Respectable", Stoler argues that the part of the colonial 
	  government's goal to preserve European superiority was through "sexual"
	  (European male) dominance in domestic affairs (McClintock et al. 346).
	  As a result, Stoler states that sexual prohibitions were 
	  "racially asymmetric and gender specific" (McClintock et al. 366).
	  This resulted in male dominated Dutch populations such as the 2:25 women
	  to men ratio in Sumatra during the late 19th century.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The regulation of gender in the Dutch East Indies that first appeared
	  in the early 18th century was specifically targeted at restricting 
	  female immigration to the colony either by preventing female immigration
	  or refusal of employment of married men by colonial Dutch companies
	  (McClintock et al. 349). The reason for this policy was due to the 
	  nature of the women who had come to the colonies previously. Many of 
	  these women came from the lowest elements of European society and it 
	  was government's view that these women "scandalized" the natives through
	  their actions by misrepresenting European society. As a result,
	  the colonial government placed a ban on female immigration exempting 
	  only wives of officials. The Dutch colonial government then went further 
	  to secure its goal of portraying the Europeans society as superior by 
	  banning European males from returning to Europe unless they had financial 
	  capabilities to provide for their natives wives forever. Since many of these 
	  men were poor workers or soldiers, it was essentially a disincentive to marry 
	  native women (Loos). Therefore, by the late 18th century, women in the Dutch
	  East Indies faced more rigid social regulation in Southeast Asia than in 
	  metropolitan Europe (McClintock et al. 344). The government's answer to the 
	  "needs" of European males was concubinage. Stoler defines concubinage as the 
	  "cohabitation" of European men with native women for domestic and sexual 
	  affairs (McClintock et al. 348). The government and Dutch colonial companies
	  adopted a policy to promote and accommodate such a lifestyle to compensate 
	  for the lack of European women in the colony. Concubinage suited the colonial
	  political goals at the time and encouraged a cheaper, healthier, and more 
	  stable lifestyle for European males corresponding to the development level of
	  the colony. As a result, the policies mentioned above and native concubines
	  were the core gender regulations of the Dutch government before the early 1900s.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Dutch gender regulation started to change in the early 20th century from it
	  previous policies due to several factors including changing ideologies, medical
	  knowledge, technological improvements, and crises. Already in the 1870s, political
	  and economic stability in the Dutch East Indies along with technological 
	  improvements of the steamboat and the Suez Canal increased immigration of 
	  European families (and thus female immigration). This trend of growing female
	  immigration continued into the 20th century and changes in political goals
	  and thus Dutch colonial gender regulation were due to several reasons. Bankoff
	  in his essay "Europe's expanding Resources Frontier: Colonialism and Environment 
	  in Southeast Asia" sites one reason for general policy changes which is that 
	  in the late 19th century, Southeast Asian colonial governments increasingly
	  looked to a long-term occupation of the region including minor materials
	  processing and markets instead of short-term resource extraction (Barrington 86). 
	  This meant that the Dutch colonial government had to increase it control over
	  the colony and this idea was physically reflected in military campaigns and 
	  on a domestic level reflected as gender regulation. Another reason for 
	  political goal changes was the supporting of a strong European family setting 
	  in colonial society where women were viewed as the "custodians of family 
	  welfare and respectability and as dedicated and willing subordinates to
	  and supporters of, colonial men" (McClintock et al. 355). Along with these 
	  views supporting female immigration to the Dutch East Indies, another 
	  factor that changed Dutch views of gender regulation was the serious problem 
	  of "degeneracy" as viewed by the Dutch colonial and home government. The 
	  degeneracy of European colonials was defined through elitist and racist
	  standards as being "unlike one's race" and moral corruption due to long
	  periods of time in the colonies. (McClintock et al. 355) The supporters 
	  of this idea in the government felt the need to guard against degeneracy by
	  increasing the European population in the colonies and essentially using women
	  for the sole purpose of reproductive activities (McClintock et al. 356-7).
	</p>
	<p>
	  the early 19th century, overall, the colonial government felt that through 
	  the promotion of families, it could build a strong, stable, and influential
	  European population in the colony through European families. European superiority
	  could be achieved and maintained by increasing the Dutch population growth. 
	  The reason for this need for control by Europeans had economic reasons, but
	  also strong political reasons to continue the authoritarianism and imperialism
	  of the past colonial government (Barrington 85). This move was also reflected
	  in the takeover of production and exchange by Europeans, which previously had 
	  been left to the natives (Barrington 94). The colonial government implemented 
	  its new gender regulation policy by lifting family restrictions, sponsoring 
	  European families on various Sumatra plantations, and keeping surveillance of
	  native men for the protection of European women. The colonial government 
	  desired an increase of European influences in agriculture and raw materials 
	  processing and European families were seen to be able to achieve these goals by
	  producing hard-working and stable family workers (Barrington 85). Stoler states
	  "redefinitions of sexual protocol and morality occurred during colonial crises"
	  (McClintock et al. 365). One colonial and global crisis that added to the need
	  to reform gender regulations and overall governmental policies was World War I.
	  After 1918, the Dutch East Indies witnessed a movement that questioned the 
	  superiority of European society. As a result, colonial political policies 
	  were geared towards increasing and asserting Dutch power in the colony. Thus 
	  the decline of concubinage in the early 1900s coincided with the standardization
	  of the Dutch colonial administration that served to strengthen the Dutch hold 
	  of the colony. Also, by this time medical experts along with an easy journey 
	  from Europe to Southeast Asia confirmed the benefits and possibilities of 
	  well-defined European society in the Dutch East Indies (McClintock et al.366).
	  A lesser driving force in the political process to promote European families 
	  and discourage concubinage but nonetheless important was the European women 
	  themselves. Stoler contends that the influx of women in the Dutch colony helped
	  clarify racial lines and brought about a decline in unrestrained social freedom
	  enjoyed by men prior to a large amount of female immigration 
	  (McClintock et al. 352). Therefore, the change in political ideologies further
	  were strengthened by the presence of women thus creating a policy of gender 
	  regulation promoting European families and discouraging the previous practices
	  of concubinage and bans on female immigration.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The process of gender regulation in the Dutch East Indies from the mid
	  1800s to the early 1900s reflects the change in colonial political ideologies
	  because changes in the regulation of European male-female relationships were
	  primarily brought about to achieve political goals. These goals at first were
	  to portray a superior European colonizer to the native populace that was 
	  reflected in European male dominance in domestic affairs and carried out by
	  policies encouraging concubinage and selective banning of female immigration 
	  to the colony from Europe. Due to ideological changes, crises, the problem of
	  degeneracy, and the efforts of women, the political goals of the early 20th 
	  century had changed from those of the 19th century to a more European orientated
	  colony where Europeans where not only superior in race but were in control of
	  economic affairs and had a strong stable society based on families. As a result, 
	  old policies where discarded in place of new regulations allowing more liberal 
	  immigration practices, the sponsoring of European families financially, and the
	  provision of the necessary European amenities to support such a colonial society.
