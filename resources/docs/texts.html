	<h3>Scalability of Webcrawlers designed in SML (Standard Meta Language)</h3>
	
	<p>
          <b>By Jeff Chiang and Justin Tung</b>
        </p>
	
	<p>
	  <b>Storage of Data</b>
	  <br />
          <br />
	  To start to consider scalable webcrawlers involving arbitrarily large data,
	  the abstract data types to be looked at should be ones that involve low 
	  worst case run times in functions such as lookup and insert. Looking at the
	  data structures learned so far, red-black balanced trees provide the optimal
	  big-O running times for lookup and insert which are both O(log n). The 
	  advantage O(log n) running times for these key functions becomes apparent
	  when n reaches billions as is the case when an indexer is storing and wading
	  through all the data on webpages. New webpages are easily inserted into the
	  existing scheme and old ones can be found easily and updated. A possible
	  implementation might be to count the length of the URL and store data based 
	  on that number. Another way could be to sort data into subtrees based on 
	  certain other ways of dividing the information on the web (i.e. file extensions 
	  of URLs, general topics). can be done via a record which stores fields that 
	  contain specific information about page title, language, format (from URLs and
	  potential file links) as well as information about the content on the page. 
	  This content like the index of webpages should be stored in the same format 
	  to provide optimal lookup times for words, phrases, etc.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  Content and page title are probably the most important elements in a
	  search in the web and should be displayed along with the URL in a results
	  page. However, advanced searches going beyond simple boolean expressions 
	  requires more complex analysis of data in the fields. Current search 
	  engines support phrase finding, negative queries, language specific queries,
	  and similar pages or pages that link to a certain page. Additional support 
	  includes searching certain directories (images, newsgroups, audio/mp3s,
	  downloads, etc.), dated page queries, and even reviewing most recent queries
	  (probably to save resources by bringing up information already searched for
	  previously). 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>How to implement these 'advanced searches'?</b>
	  <br />
          <br />
	  Using the data structure setup discussed above, advanced searches really 
	  are based on good algorithms that go through the data stored in an index 
	  and pulls out the important information. Phrase finding wil l require the
	  ability of the search engine to parse text into groups of words and compare
	  them, once a page meets this phrase requirement, the URL and its corresponding
	  information should be sent back. Negative queries work similar to 'positive'
	  queries and it should be a negation of the implementation used for regular 
	  queries. Similar pages can be searched for by keywords in page titles, text,
	  and other data stored on the page. Finding links to a certain page should be
	  easy using the tree setup since a find on all URLs that have a common link 
	  can be done and the URLs returned. Subtopics and more specific areas of the
	  web can be implemented by dividing data during the insert into the web index
	  as mentioned above with subtrees. Then searches will be limited to those 
	  trees when needed, thus decreasing running times by limiting what topics/data
	  to search for. The implementation of storing recent or most popular queries 
	  can be done by storing a set of URLs in a database (balanced tree) either
	  for reference or for near future use. This storing of returns on queries
	  helps cut down the amount of queries (in which many could be the same) to
	  a search engine.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Analysis of Running Times and Scalability 
	    considerations to Web Search Algorithms</b>
	  <br />
          <br />
	  Since all the webpages are stored as balanced trees and within those 
	  trees, the nodes store content data in balanced trees, search for a specific
	  page (i.e. URL) could be done in O(log n) time. The good thing about balanced
	  trees within balanced trees is that any other type of search that might access
	  fields in the nodes will take at most O(log n) time. Since data on the 
	  internet is so large, worst-case running times do provide a good estimation
	  as smaller orders such as constants (accessing data) do not really affect 
	  running time. As a result of processing terabytes of data, frequency of crawls,
	  and the general expectations of speed on the internet, algorithms with the 
	  smallest possible big-O are the most desirable. Fast algorithms will be able
	  to service the large amount of people using the search engine everyday in good
	  time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Caching Web Pages</b> 
	  <br />
          <br />
	  Although the caching of every examined page may seem like an impossible task,
	  it is indeed what Google does.  Google employs a compression technique on
	  each document that trades off speed for file size. Its 3:1 compression ratio
	  allows moderate space-saving while still retaining adequate retrieval speed. 
	  Each document is stored with a docID, length, and URL.  In addition to this 
	  central repository, a document index, lexicon, hit list, and hit list indexes
	  are stored as well. The document index stores in each entry the current document
	  status, a pointer into the repository, a document checksum, and various statistics. 
	  The hit list corresponds to a list of occurrences of a particular word in a
	  particular document including position, font, and capitalization information.
	  All of this information is then used to create the hit list indexes, 
	  which record the docID of a document that contains the words in the hit list.
	  Even the queries themselves are cached, resulting in faster search times
	  should the same query be repeated. The result of these data structures blended
	  together is a fast and accurate return of the pages requested by users.
	  Frequency of Web Crawls and Changing Web pages In order to keep track of 
	  what pages have or have not changed, a record of the time of last access
	  of any page needs to be maintained.  Any further attempt to access the same
	  page in less than the specified period of time is rejected and "local copy
	  up to date" condition is signaled. If a page has been accessed previously,
	  the HTTP HEAD access method is used to determine the last modified date of
	  the current remote version. If this is unchanged from the last modified date
	  of the current local copy then no further network traffic ensues and "local 
	  copy up to date" condition is signaled.  If the remote version has changed
	  then an HTTP GET access gets the new copy. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  A search engine needs to maintain information about the last 10 accesses
	  or attempted accesses to a resource. The stored information includes the
	  date of access, time needed for transfer, amount of data transferred and
	  the HTTP status code [right name]. In the internal database the status
	  code is extended with non-standard to indicate various types of 
	  communication failure. If successive access attempts fail, the page is
	  assumed to be no longer available. It is marked as such and may still 
	  be included in the database but is presented to the searching user with
	  a warning. Eventually the page will be eliminated entirely from the database.
	</p>

	<h3>Water Conservation Presentation</h3>
	
	<p>
          <b>By Justin Tung</b>
        </p>

	<h4>Educate for the Earth 2000-2001: Presentation Sheet</h4>

	<p>
	  Information taken from: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ow/kids.html">http://www.epa.gov/ow/kids.html</a> 
	  as well as various other net sources. Target audience is elementary school
	  children and above.
	</p>

	<h4>Presentation</h4>

	<span class="f_blue">What is water?</span>

	<p>
	  Water comes in 3 forms ice, water (the type that we usually see in 
	  oceans and lakes), and vapor (form of water in the air) - all have a
	  clear color. 
	</p>

	<span class="f_red">Where does it come from?</span>

	<p>
	  Water comes from sources on the Earth and is located in many places: <br />
          <br />
	  
	  Some of these are: oceans, rivers, lakes, atmosphere, underground wells, and
	  glaciers in places like the Antarctica.
	</p>

	<span class="f_orange">Why is it important?</span>

	<p>
	  Our bodies are around 55-60 % water and the earth is 70% water. <br />
	  We need water to live and stay healthy since a large percent of us is water. <br />
	  
	  Like us plants and animals also need water to survive. These include all living
	  things both on land and underwater and of course water is obviously important to
	  sea life like coral reefs, fish and sea plants. 
	</p>

	<span class="f_green">What is water conservation?</span>

	<p>
	  It means to save and recycle our water so we use as least water possible.
	  <br />
	  "Water recycling is a critical element for managing our water resources. 
	  Through water conservation and water recycling, we can meet environmental 
	  needs and still have sustainable development and a viable economy." <br />
	  <i>-Felicia Marcus, Regional Administrator Water Division Region IX</i> 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Water recycling is reusing treated wastewater for beneficial purposes such
	  as farming, business, and home processes as well as refilling a ground water
	  supplies (water recharge). A common type of recycled water is water that has
	  been reclaimed from city wastewater, or sewage. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Through the natural water cycle, the earth has recycled and reused water for
	  millions of years. Water recycling, though, generally refers to projects that
	  use technology to speed up these natural processes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are numerous water recycling projects to increase the quality of water
	  that is recycled because the usual quality now is non-drinkable, but still 
	  useful for farming and industries.
	</p>
	<p>
	  By providing an additional source of water, water recycling can help us find
	  ways to decrease water taken from sensitive ecosystems. Other benefits include
	  decreasing wastewater discharges and reducing and preventing pollution. Recycled 
	  water can also be used to create or enhance wetlands and habitats. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  In some cases, the reasons for water recycling comes not from a water supply 
	  need, but from a need to eliminate or decrease wastewater discharge to the
	  ocean, an estuary, or a stream. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  While water recycling is a sustainable approach and can be cost-effective 
	  in the long term, the treatment of wastewater for reuse and the installation
	  of distribution systems can be initially expensive compared to such water 
	  supply alternatives as imported water or ground water. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  As water demands and environmental needs grow, water recycling will play
	  a greater role in our overall water supply. By working together to overcome
	  problems, water recycling, along with water conservation, can help us to
	  conserve and manage our vital water resources to last into the future. 
	</p>

	<h4>Activities</h4>
	
	<p>
	  What do you do already at home that conserves water? 
	  <br />
          <br />
	  Watershed - Adopt Your Watershed - http://www.epa.gov/adopt/ 
	  <br />
          <br />  
	  Encourages the saving and looking over of the nation's water resources.
	  Through this effort, Environmental Protection Agency challenges people in
	  the community to join them and others who are working to protect and restore
	  our valuable rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, ground water, and estuaries. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>What you can do at home</b>
	  <ul>
	    <li>At home you can significantly reduce the amount of wastewater from
	      home systems and sewage treatment plants by conserving water - less 
	      water use means less waste</li>
	    
	    <li>You can try using low-flow taps, shower heads, reduced-flow toilet
	      flushing equipment, and water saving appliances such as dish and clothes
	      washers</li>
	    <li>Repair leaking water sources in your house</li>
	    <li>Avoid letting taps run unnecessarily like when people brush their
	      teeth they leave the tap on</li>
	    <li>Wash your car only when necessary; use a bucket to save water or
	      go to a carwash that uses water efficiently and disposes of runoff
	      properly - runoff is a source of waste and pollution</li>
	    <li>Do not over-water your lawn or garden. Over-watering may increase 
	      leaching of fertilizers to ground water</li>
	    <li>When your lawn or garden needs watering, use slow-watering techniques
	      such as trickle irrigation or soaker hoses. (Such devices reduce runoff
	      and are 20- percent more effective than sprinklers.)</li> 
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Cleaning water process (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407060237if_/http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/jt96/images/wattreat.gif">figure 1</a>): 
	  
	  <ol>
	    <li>Coagulation - Coagulation removes dirt and other small things 
	      caught in the water. Chemicals are added to water to form tiny 
	      sticky balls that stick to the dirt and sink to the bottom of the 
	      water.</li>
	    <li>Sedimentation - The heavy balls settle to the bottom and the clear 
	      water moves to filtration.</li>
	    <li>Filtration - The water passes through filters, some made of layers of
	      sand, gravel, and charcoal that help remove even smaller pieces of dirt 
	      and other things.</li>
	    <li>Disinfection - A small amount of cleaning liquid is used to kill
	      any bacteria or small living things that may be in the water.</li>
	    <li>Storage - Water is stored in a large pool in order for dis-infection 
	      to take place. The water then flows through pipes to homes and businesses
	      in the community.</li> 
	  </ol>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Stream erosion - the sides of the stream should be maintained -
	      the sides are weak because people have stripped the sides of plant
	      life which holds the soil together</li>
	    <li>Oil dumping - leads to pollution of soil and ground water, 
	      also affects local wildlife</li>
	    <li>Car leaking</li>
	    <li>Over fertilization - can kill plants, harm the soil and
	      create runoff pollution where fertilizers enter the water system</li>
	    <li>Water waste - we want to conserve water and use a little as possible 
	      to keep our environment healthy</li>

	<h3>How to Succeed in Technical/General Liberal Arts Courses</h3>
	
	<p>
          <b>by Justin Tung</b>
        </p>
	
	<p>
	  <b>Introduction</b>
	  <br />
          <br />
	  I decided to write the text when I reflected on my most successful 
	  courses grade-wise in university. I also found that these courses were the ones I 
	  gained a large understanding and appreciation of the material and retained 
	  much memory of what was taught in the course. I found I studied for them 
	  all in a similar format and there was a general study method I used
	  unconsciously. I should also add that these particular courses were taught
	  by excellent professors and teaching assistants and often had good supportive
	  reading material. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The following text assumes a kind of lecture-recitation (section)
	  class structure which is sometimes not the case if different types of classes 
	  (like labs, discussion sessions, etc.) are available. Also, some of the
	  points (maybe all of them) sound quite common sensical or obvious to most
	  students, but the difficult part is to attain the <em>DISCIPLINE</em> required to 
	  carry everything out to the end (i.e. go to all your classes, even the
	  boring ones). If you attain this skill, you will be guaranteed a sense
	  of accomplishment
	  and learning and the rewards may be unlimited. In hindsight, this so-called
	  discipline is much easier to obtain when:
	  <ol>
	    <li>You like the subject/course content</li>
	    <li>You enjoy the professor, TAs, teachers, etc.</li>
	    <li>The presentation and learning styles suit you</li>
	    <li>You chose the course because you like it</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  1. Lecture 
	  <br />
	  <ul>
	    <li> 
	      Read assignments for lecture no more than a week later so that the material 
	      is still fresh in your head. This method aids understanding of the material. 
	      The closer to lecture you read the material, the better your understanding 
	      and learning.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Some classes even promote reading material to be covered in lecture
	      before lecture. Be sure to at least attempt this since the course
	      organizer sometimes presumes knowledge during the lecture which may
	      be important for understanding.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  2. Section 
	  <br />
	  <ul>
	    <li> 
	      Go over homework before a section and be prepared to ask questions if any.
	      Do not forget to pay close attention to the questions of others, often
	      these questions reflect common weaknesses in understanding of material. 
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If you do not have the time to go over (or even take a peek) at the 
	      homework or it is not necessary to know it, make sure to take comprehensive 
	      notes. 
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Make sure you have at least a slight idea of the material covered in 
	      sections and in some cases section should be a review and expanding on
	      known material.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
 	  3. Essays/Projects/Problem Sets (Homeworks) 
	  <br />
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      If you have questions about homework go to office hours or ask the teacher. 
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      For projects and problem sets, you should look over the entire document
	      the task at reviewing homework before it is done does not have to be a
	      lengthy process and may only take a couple minutes. 
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      One of the problems with homeworks is knowing when to talk to a teacher.
	      This timing should be determined by you. It difficult to analyze when 
	      the timing may be too early or too late, but being a little earlier
	      always helps.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  For essays, there are numerous methods on the internet about how to go
	  about writing a good essay so I will not go into that except to say
	  the general chronological order is: think about the problem/question, 
	  research, write a Thesis/Outline and organize arguments/data, 
	  set down which points go into which arguments, then write!.
	</p>
	<p>
	  4. Exams
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Review course material to be covered and LEARN it. I find it helpful to
	      rewrite notes, key ideas, etc. or to write up "exam notes" which are
	      easily to review in the few hours/minutes before the exam. 
	    </li>
	    <li>Do questions/mock essays/practice exams</li>
	  </ul>
        </p>

	<h3>Conducting searches/research and data mining on the web</h3>

	<span class="f_purple">How to find information and resources</span>
	<br />
	<div class="bluebox">
	<p>
	  This section was originally part of my links area until I realized that 
	  it was important enough for its own section. The sites below helped me to
	  find most my links and learn how to make and design webpages. Also, using
	  the Internet has saved me countless hours in searching for and learning 
	  information. There is no real path to follow but I have listed the links 
	  below in order of importance to me. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <i>One thing to keep in mind though when looking at information on the internet
	    is <b>do not</b> trust or believe everything you read.</i> A large amount of
	  common internet (and urban legend) spread myths are available at 
	  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">www.snopes.com</a>, which at least a couple
	  you will have heard of, depending on your age and experiences.
	  In the print world, most serious
	  information sources go through screening, editors, publishers, and finally
	  critics, while online information can be published by anybody, although
	  if you get the information from a reliable website (e.g. a government one)
	  you can rest a little more assured.
	</p>
      </div>
      <br />

	<span class="f_red">My process to find information online:</span>

	<p>
	  <b>1)</b> Usually I proceed to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
	  first and find the information right away. However, some information is 
	  found easier using other search engines (e.g. specialized ones) 
	  and Yahoo for example is best 
	  for finding financial and map information fast.
	</p>
	<p> 
	  <b>2)</b> Of course finding the resources and search engines is half the effort, 
	  the other half is searching smart and knowing when to move on to other pages 
	  in the search, follow links on a page, or try another approach. Ideally, 
	  you should choose a search that narrows down the number of pages you have 
	  to look at to a manageable amount. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  This process might involve adding more keywords, specifying advanced search
	  conditions, looking at different resources, etc. At other times, simple is
	  better (i.e. typing in virginia.com to find information about Virginia, USA) 
	  or just doing very general searches to find information quickly. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>3)</b> If you are having a hard time finding information because it is 
	  relatively specific try the meta search engines or try looking up sites
	  in Google that pertain to your general subject area and continue the search
	  within those sites.
	</p>
	<p>
	  4) In case the above steps fail, try accessing the resources below.
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>: One of the best search engines 
	  with a fast and efficient searching algorithm.<br />
	  <a href="http://www.about.com">About.com</a>: Expert guides in many subjects 
	  About.com like Yahoo contains information on many things except that the sites
	  are managed by experts in their field who give their input about a subject and 
	  provide a set of links from which to explore. This site has easily moved
	  up my priority list in visiting when searching for topical information.<br />
	  <a href="http://www.lycos.com">LYCOS</a>: My second choice for a keyword 
	  search engine, sometimes it finds sites Google does not and I guess as a
	  result uses a different page index and/or searching algorithm.<br />
	  <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">YAHOO!</a>: Excellent array of resources, 
	  contains just about everything (current events, finance, mail, maps, etc) and 
	  has many services, it's different from some sites in that information on
	  Yahoo is sorted using library science methods.<br />
	  <a href="http://www.usenet.com">usenet</a>: 
	  Newsgroups have been a source of interaction between varied internet users 
	  and sometimes good short or long-term sources about information where a
	  personalized response or interaction is required. You might consider
	  looking into the 1000s of newsgroups for the topic that interests you or
	  ask people how to obtain information.
