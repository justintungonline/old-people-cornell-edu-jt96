<p><b><a name="1">1</a>. Introduction</b></p>
<p>The United States Code is released to the general public by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050307073424/http://uscode.house.gov/download.htm">U.S. House of Representatives</a>.  This code is an ASCII version to which the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050307073424/http://lii.law.cornell.edu/"> Legal Information Institute</a> (LII) adds value.
The improved version is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050307073424/http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/">here</a>.<br>
<br>
An earlier CS 501 team (Legal Data Markup Software Project) and a later
student project developed programs for the LII that convert the raw ASCII output of
the House of Representatives to XML, for subsequent reuse in various settings. This XML is then converted to
HTML producing the current website. This conversion was facilitated by XSLT scripts. The existing web user
interface supports a search engine, HTML legal code, cross-referencing, and notes on each section of the code.
The US Code currently gets about half a million hits a day.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20050307073424im_/http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/jt96/resources/projects/cs501/lii1.jpg" width="400" height="288"><br>

Figure 3: A section of the Code.</p>
<p><i><a name="1.1">1.1</a> Goals</i></p>
<p>
The new project, overseen by Thomas Bruce, Co-Director of the LII, is to create PDF versions of code from the existing
XML. In the current website, users navigate through HTML links to see the
leaves of the legal code tree, which are called 'sections'. Our goal is to implement a system
so that users can print more than one section at a time, and in a format that
preserves the meaning of the Code.</p>
<p>Users can pick sections and larger divisions (called 'chapter', 'part',
and other similar names) via a shopping cart system. The new PDF format
adds printability and portability to the legal code, which was hard to achieve with HTML.</p>
<p>The cart
functionality will be integrated into the existing website and will be present in each HTML page of legal code. The
idea is to charge the user for the service, which includes the delivery of PDF documents.
Customers will also receive additional
information (e.g. table of contents, notes, cross-referencing) relevant to their
selections. The reason for adding a shopping cart is to charge users for PDF
conversion, which inhibits overuse of the system and reminds users not to waste paper, since most saved documents are printed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to define all the requirements of the PDF delivery
system needed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>convert XML data to PDF for portability and printability;</li>
  <li>create a logical and easy-to-use document selection user interface and order placement
    process;</li>
  <li>create a shopping cart system that allows the LII to recoup some of the
    costs of maintaining, updating, and delivering the large document database;</li>
  <li>allow adequate testing for the products;</li>
  <li>assist the client in maintaining and updating the products (software designed by the team) 
    after the end of the semester.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><a name="1.2">1.2</a>   Glossary</i></p>
<p>Since the products are not intended for public consumption, most of the
terminology used in this document should be understandable to the technical
personnel involved in the project. This glossary serves to provide a common
understanding among the parties involved in the project.</p>

<p>We expect to add, during development, a section of typographic terms and other specialized vocabulary related to the print version.</p>
<p><i><a name="1.3">1.3</a> Knowledge Constraints</i></p>
<p>At the current time, neither the client nor the developers possess the
necessary typographical expertise to properly and adequately express the
requirements for typesetting in the PDF files. As a result, Version 1.0 of this
document does not include the vocabulary or the requirements for this portion of
the project. Instead, the developers will meet with the client and other quality
assurance personnel to develop such requirements. At this time, the client will
provide various samples, and the developers will present outputs that are
possible. Differences will then be discussed and a consensus reached on the
proper handling.</p>

<p><i><a name="2.1">2.1</a> Hardware Platform</i></p>
<p>The client requests that both development work and the production system be hosted on Lula, which is
a P-III 800MHz with 2 GB of SDRAM and a RAID array of 2 40GB hard drive. Lula
may be replaced sometime in the future. In the meantime, performance and
resource requirements are described in terms of Lula, and in terms of users'
Internet connection speed where applicable.</p>
<p><i><a name="2.2">2.2</a> Software Platform</i></p>
<p>Lula is running on Red Hat Linux v 7.1. The web server is powered by Apache.
Java version is 1.3.1.02. The various Apache-derived XSL software - Xalan,
Xerces, their FOP processor, and others - are also hosted here. These software
are pre-installed by the client. In addition, a PDG Shopping Cart system is also
available. Currently, this system provides software purchasing
capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><a name="2.3">2.3</a> Additional software for project</i></p>
<p>Partly due to the fact that this project is mostly funded by Red Hat Linux,
and partly at the client's insistence, it is highly encouraged
that only free software is used for the production and development processes.
The developers do not yet foresee any use for proprietary software at this time.</p>
<p>The developers should know or learn the following technologies in order to
complete the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows/Unix - general development and testing, such as generating PDF
    files;</li>
  <li>XML - the format of source input, it is also the language in which the

  <li>XSLT - the language that converts XML into XSL-FO;</li>

<p><b><a name="3">3.</a>  PDF Conversion Requirements</b></p>

<p>This section discusses the both functional and non-functional requirements
relating to the production of PDF files based on XML files from the LDMS
project.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.1">3.1</a> Interfaces</i></p>
<p>It is assumed that the XML source will be provided at a specified location,
supplied to the converter via command-line argument or settings file. The output
will be stored in one specified directory or its subfolder, if pre-generation is used, or in a
cache directory, if on-the-fly conversion is adopted. There may be a tree
structure for the folders, such as one folder for each title.</p>

<p>A wrapper should be provided to convert one title at a time. It should be
modifiable so that in the future, more than one title can be converted at a
time. It can then be invoked as necessary.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.2">3.2</a> Functionality</i></p>

<p>The foremost objective is to faithfully re-create a PDF version of the print
edition as provided by the Government Printing Office. Lawyers depend highly on
the visual structure of the legal code, and any alteration to the visual format, such as indentation or
extra whitespace, can significantly change the meaning of the Code. Due to resource constraints, we must rely on
the XML conversion provided by the previous CS 501 team in LDMS, although efforts
will be made where bugs are found. The tagging in XML source is
thus assumed to be accurate.</p>

<p>The
print edition of the U.S. Code thus serves as a useful reference for formatting, such as heading, typefaces, and so
on.
Sample sections will be provided in the future as neither the developers nor the
client currently has the knowledge about typesetting terminology or constraints to specify such
requirements at the present time.&nbsp;</p>

<p> There are two ways to convert XML into PDF.
Pre-generation means doing the conversion at the time updates are received.
On-the-fly means converting at time of order fulfillment - after a user places
an order for a
document. Most of the requirements are independent of the method of conversion,
unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.3">3.3</a> Usability</i></p>

<p> The PDF conversion tool will be invoked at specified intervals or upon
stimuli, such as changes in XML, if pre-generation is used, or invoked
automatically, such as when requested by a user, if on-the-fly conversion is
used. In either case, maintenance personnel can quickly find out how to operate
the conversion, if at all, through documentation.</p>

<p>System administrators and future developers will need approximately 5-7 days to familiarize with the
tools and code, to be able to trouble-shoot, fix bugs, and deliver new features.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.4">3.4</a> Reliability</i></p>

<p>Due to the large number of users, reliability is a top priority. It should be optimized
even at the cost of functionality or performance. Downtime should be limited to
an hour per year. The current site and services should remain available during feature addition or bug
fixing, and not be affected by any work on this project.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.5">3.5</a> Performance</i></p>

<p> Currently, a bot checks for U.S. Code updates on the
Congressional website once a day. Each updates usually consists of one title, or
a series of consecutive titles. PDF conversion for each title should finish within 12 hours.
This applies whether pre-generation is used, in which case the timer starts when
XML input becomes
available, or whether on-the-fly is used, in which case the 12 hours start when an order for that part of the Code
is placed.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.6">3.6</a> Capacity and Resource Utilization</i></p>

<p>There is no efficient way that the developers know of to control the amount
of resources used for conversion, such as preventing the PDF converter from
occupying more than half of the computing cycles. Instead, the process should be able to run with a lower priority than normal tasks,
thus not using excessive amounts of system resources.</p>

<p>Storage usage is not expected to be significant. Prototyping tests
show no more than 3-to-1 ration between PDF and HTML file sizes in the worst
case.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.7">3.7</a> Structure Specification</i></p>

<p>The follow is regarding the format of PDFs to be delivered to user:</p>

<p>Each section of the U.S. Code shall begin on a new page.</p>

<p>For higher hierarchies, multiple sections are presented in the same file. To
save space (and paper), the developers will investigate the possibility of
placing multiple sections on a page when they do not overflow.</p>

<p>Each section (or chapter, part, etc.) shall be delivered in a separate
document. Preferably, an optimization will allow the user to receive the
immediate supersection if many divisions on the same level are requested.</p>

<p>Each division that is delivered as a document should include extra information relevant to that division,
including notes and cross-references.</p>

<p>Each page shall have a header showing the higher hierarchy necessary for
identifying page contents. It should include the title number, and the chapter
number, part number, and so on, if applicable. A footer showing the page number appears on the page as
well, and should correspond to the information on the Table of Contents. A TOC
shall be created for each delivered division. Appendices (without restructuring due to inconsistent organizational
structures), and catchlines will also be included where available. Structural navigation-aiding tags
should be used to create cross-links so
as to provide ease of use of documents.</p>

<p>For this project, one level above section, and the individual sections, are desired for conversion. This should be controlled by a line in the
settings file so future improvements can be made as resources become adequate.</p>

<p><i><a name="3.8">3.8</a> Acceptable Bugs</i></p>

<p>Defects that do not directly contradict the above PDF conversion requirements are deemed acceptable. Examples include long-term memory leaks,
spurious error messages, and minor differences between output and print
editions.</p>

<p><b><a name="4">4.</a>  Document Selection and Order Placement Requirements</b></p>

<p>These relate to what the user should be able to do on the website.</p>

<p><i><a name="4.1">4.1</a>  Document Selection</i></p>

<p>A user can add a section or its immediate supersection
to the shopping cart for delivery in PDF format. The Code will be presented
hierarchically as it is. The user can browse by following links that lead to lower
levels, such as chapters and sections. Or they may arrive at some division
via the search engine. A link to add a particular sub-division to the cart
should be placed next to links to such divisions in the hierarchy and on the page
containing that section itself.</p>

<p><i><a name="4.2">4.2</a>  Shopping Cart</i></p>

<p>There will be a link to the shopping cart on all pages where the user can review orders,
remove items, or confirm the order. He or she then enters payment
or credit card information, which will be passed onto Verisign for verification.</p>

<p>The client shall be responsible for determining the fee structure (charging
scheme). The developer shall be responsible for creating a system that supports
different charges for differing amounts of material (eg. a section can be
charged differently than a chapter).</p>

<p><i><a name="4.3">4.3</a> Usability</i></p>

<p>Since the output is delivered from web pages, UI complexity should be kept to a
minimum. Users, who are mostly casual users of computers, should be able to intuitively
know how to use the site or spend no more than 3 minutes learning though easy to read
help documents. Some useful references are e-commerce sites: most people find
sites such as Amazon.com easy and intuitive.</p>

<p><i><a name="4.4">4.4</a> Performance</i></p>

<p>The website should be quick, since most information is text (or rather,
HTML). Response time should not differ significantly than current performance
levels.</p>

<p><i><a name="4.5">4.5</a> Acceptable Bugs</i></p>

<p>Defects that do not directly contradict selection or placement requirements
are deemed acceptable. Examples include bugs in the supplied shopping cart
system that do not prevent orders from being placed or fulfilled.</p>

<p><a href="requirement.html#toc">back to TOC</a></p>

<hr color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b><a name="5">5.</a>  Order Fulfillment Requirements</b></p>

<p>These relate to the experience after an order is confirmed.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.1">5.1</a> Functionality</i></p>

<p>Order confirmation should be emailed to the user. Each
email shall include the identity of the purchaser, the time of purchase and
cost, and the identity of the document.</p>

<p>The AOL email limit, 5 MB, may well be insufficient for certain long
sections. Other services may have even lower limits on attachment size.
Therefore, documents will not be sent. Rather, links to the generated PDF files
will be emailed to the user after they become available. Each section or
immediate supersection
shall be contained in one file, but the actual file path will be invisible. An
indecipherable URL will be generated for each document in every order, and the
system shall redirect file requests to the correct file. In this way, users
cannot guess or obtain the paths to other files they did not order, but at the
same time can download the documents at a convenient time.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.2">5.2</a> Usability</i></p>

<p>The system sends links to PDF files to the user by email.
It is assumed that the user knows how to download files and use them. A short tutorial will be provided on the site for
reference for those who do not.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.3">5.3</a> Performance</i></p>

<p>An order confirmation shall be provided by email within 5 minutes after the order is confirmed. The
PDF conversion time has already been discussed in the conversion requirements.
Since links are provided to users, the files are downloaded directly by users,
so that the time to receive the documents will be constrained by the user's
Internet connection.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.4">5.4</a> Logging</i></p>

<p>Each order should be logged. In the future, this log can be expanded in
functionality and will be used for system analysis, usage
pattern recognition, and in
cases where customers have questions or problems with orders.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.5">5.5</a> Invalid Information</i></p>

<p>If a credit card is rejected, the order shall be rejected, and no
confirmation should be sent. The user shall be responsible for mistyped email
addresses, although efforts will be made to confirm the address more than once.
If on-the-fly conversion is used, and document conversion fails, the user will receive an email
notice.&nbsp;The system will not support refunds at this time.</p>

<p><i><a name="5.6">5.6</a> Acceptable Bugs</i></p>

<p>Defects that do not directly contradict selection or placement requirements
are deemed acceptable. Examples include long-term memory leaks.</p>

<p><a href="requirement.html#toc">back to TOC</a></p>

<hr color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b><a name="6">6.</a> Quality Assurance Requirements</b></p>
<p>The development team shall be responsible for testing permissible during the
Spring 2002 semester.</p>
<p><i><a name="6.1">6.1</a> Testing</i></p>
<p>Testing shall be done through the implementation phase, with special emphasis
on structural soundness in PDF files and large numbers of simultaneous requests.
The development team will meet with the client and other quality assurance
personnel at least once a week to resolve problems. Sample outputs will be
provided to ensure that the structure does not deviate materially from the print
edition of the U.S. Code.</p>
<p><a name="6.2">6.2</a> Bug Reports</p>
<p>Bug reports filed by the client or website users before the end of the
project shall be handled by the developers as time permits (all last minute bugs
may not be resolved).</p>

<hr color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b><a name="7">7.</a> Documentation Requirements</b></p>
<p>Documentation is divided into three parts: for LII personnel and future CS
501 teams, for CS 501 staff, and for website users. First, some required
documents.</p>
<p><i><a name="7.1">7.1</a>  Program Design Document</i></p>
<p>Development of the LDMS shall be documented by a program design document (PDD)
outlining the implementation. It shall be the central reference for developers
responsible for understanding, maintaining, and extending the LDMS. The PDD
shall contain a high level view of the LDMS processing engine, detail individual
processing components, and display all interfaces, within and external to, the
system. To aid in supporting the LDMS, no development diverging from the
requirements shall occur without peer approval, without modifying requirements,
nor without modifying the PDD.</p>
<p><i><a name="7.2">7.2</a> Website Users</i></p>
<p>A simple walk-through will be provided in case a website user is unable to
order his or her desired documents. It will link to customer support
information. Prominent help should be placed next to ordering links and lead
users to walk-throughs and detailed instructions as well as contact information
for personal technical support.</p>
<p><i><a name="7.3">7.3</a> LII Personnel and Future CS 501 Teams</i></p>
<p>Documentation will be provided so that both LII personnel and future CS 501
teams who work with LII can understand the design and implementation of the PDF
conversion, shopping cart system, and PDF delivery system. Scripts modified or
created will have helpful documentation in the source code. Other documents will
address possible failure modes and suggests remedies.</p>
<p>PDF filenames will be inherited from the corresponding XML files. For
instance, Title1Chpt1Sec1.xml will be converted into a PDF file named
Title1Chpt1Sec1.pdf. Higher nodes in the hierarchy, such as Title1Chpt1, will be
created as well, aggregating all lower levels in that portion of the U.S. code.</p>
<p><i><a name="7.4">7.4</a> CS 501 Staff</i></p>
<p>This requirement specification, as well as other documentation in the future,
will be designed to allow Professor Arms and TA consultant to understand the
progression of the project.</p>

<hr color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b><a name="8">8.</a> Future Considerations</b></p>
<p>On-the-fly PDF generation is more flexible in allowing more presentation
formats. The current project will attempt to allow such a feature to be
&quot;plugged in&quot; in the future. Additional plugins may include queueing, so
that system administrators can manually assign priorities to user requests (eg.
shorter jobs receive higher priority); statistics can be collected to monitor
the use of the system and allow intelligent updates and improvements. On the user
side, an improved user interface with radio buttons, tree navigation of the code, and
an optimized ordering system that incorporates data gathering by the LII may be implemented.
In addition, PDF files that contain arbitrary levels of hierarchy may be created with
the ability to convert more than one title at once. Logging may be extended to
provide more in-depth and advanced data mining regarding usage patterns. </p>

<p><b><a name="9">9.</a> Legal Requirements</b></p>

<p><i><a name="9.1">9.1</a>     Licensing Requirements</i></p>

<p>The final product should be extendable at the source level by the client. Additionally, the issue of possible revenues generated by such extension of
the product must be addressed.  As much of the code may result in deriving from freely-available sources, care must be taken to ensure that use of such
code does not entail legal duties which are inconsistent with possible future commercial use of the product.  Therefore, a contract has been drawn
up to address these issues.</p>

<p><i><a name="9.1.1">9.1.1</a>     Software Development Contract</i></p>

<p>Both Project Sponsors and Developers agree to the following:</p>

<p>1.      That all code, documentation and other copyright-protected material produced in the course of this CS501 project (PROJECT MATERIAL) shall
understood by all to be the work of joint authors and not as a work made for hire;</p>

<p>2.      That the joint authors shall include all the undersigned, the CS501 students working on the project and Thomas R. Bruce;</p>

<p>3.      That despite joint authorship there will be no duty on the part of the student authors, individually or as a group, to account for any return
on subsequent commercial use or development of the PROJECT MATERIAL;</p>

<p>4.      That, in contrast, should Thomas R. Bruce or the Legal Information Institute realize royalties or other direct financial return from licensing
any of the PROJECT MATERIAL there will be a duty to account to the other joint authors for any such revenue net of costs; and</p>

<p>5.      That the developers will use care to assure that the PROJECT MATERIAL does not incorporate code covered by copyright and licensed on
terms that are inconsistent with unlimited noncommercial distribution.</p>

<p><i><a name="9.2">9.2</a> Legal, Copyright and Other Notices</i></p>

<p>At this juncture, the final product shall be distributed without any warranty, express or implied, and without even the implications of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  The developers will make every effort to ensure that the product fulfills the requirements
listed above. There will, however, be no legal duties to ensure any of them are fulfilled.</p>
