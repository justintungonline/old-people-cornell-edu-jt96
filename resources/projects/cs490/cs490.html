	Interval Analysis is a means of representing uncertainty by replacing single
	(fixed-point) values with intervals. In this project, <b> interval analysis is
	applied to a foraging model in behavioural ecology</b>. The model describes an 
        individual foraging in a collection of continuously renewing resource patches.
	This model is used to determine the optimal residence time of the forager in a
	resource patch assuming the forager wants to maximize its rate of resource
	intake. Before applying interval analysis, fixed-point (non-interval)
	optimization will be done to serve as a basis. Certain parameters in the mode
	will then be replaced with intervals and interval-based optimization conducted.
	
      </p>
      <p>
	A comparison of the interval and fixed-point results will be done as well as
	analysis of parameter intervals and their constraints, root approximations, and
	applications to the model.

	<b>2. <a name="ia" />Interval Analysis</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	The paper covers only a brief outline of <b>Interval Analysis</b> 
	  <b> (IA) </b> and the math associated with IA that is needed to understand 
	  the topics covered and assumes some prior knowledge of IA and Matlab though 
	  it is possible to understand the applications to the foraging model without
	  that knowledge. For a formal mathematical introduction and in depth coverage
	  of concepts see Schwartz (1999) or Moore (1966) listed in the references.
	  Interval analysis is a deterministic way of <i>representing uncertainty 
	    in values by replacing a number with a range of values</i> (Schwartz 17). 
	  Fixed-point analysis is simply analysis using non-interval values where 
	  there is no uncertainty in the values. As a result, IA uncertainty concepts
	  can be used to model varying biological parameters in the ecological model 
	  and also to frame fixed-point results. One website providing an excellent gateway
	  to interval analysis resources and information is at

	  <b>3. <a name="beco" />Behavioural Ecology and the Foraging Model</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Foraging models in general study two basic problems of a forager: which food/prey 
	  items to consume and when to leave an area containing food (a resource patch).
	  This paper will concentrate on the latter as an optimization problem. The paper
	  discusses the framework of foraging models and also explains foraging and 
	  optimality models through the three main components of decision, currency, and
	  constraint assumptions.  Given the structure of a foraging model, it is easy 
	  to frame a model examining the foraging of a single animal over a collection of 
	  distinct resource patches. I have taken the model along with its decision,
	  currency, and constraint assumptions from Wilson (2000) (in references) so
	  the construction of the model's equations, its origins, and an analysis and extensions
	  of the model in C can be found in his book. The rules of the forager in the 
	  model are that the animal stays for a fixed time before moving to a new resource 
	  patch, time is discrete, and patch resource values (biomass, energy, etc) grow
	  logistically. The decision assumption lies in the determination of the fixed time
	  value. Assuming behavioural and evolutionary mechanisms drive foragers to optimize 
	  the time spent on each patch. This assumption implies that they will stay long
	  enough to optimize the rate of resource consumption. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The mathematical conclusion, explained in the paper using the model's structure
	  is that the optimal time to leave a patch is when the expected rate of resource
	  return decreases to the average rate of return of a new patch (a statement of
	  the <b>marginal value theorem</b> for foraging). This result then allows an
	  optimization problem to be constructed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>4. <a name="metho" />Methodology</b>
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  The optimization problem was approached in two ways. One way was a fixed point
	  analysis of the problem using the <i>bisection method</i> after some
	  graphical analysis of the functions involved. The second way was an IA
	  approach using the <b>interval Newton's method</b>. The results and details
	  of these two methods and their comparisons can be found in the paper. A
	  <b>stability analysis</b> was also conducted on the model, which was
	  testing the limits of the uncertainties of the variables before the model 
	  "broke down".
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>5. <a name="summ" />Summary Results</b>
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  The values obtained from both optimization methods corresponded well 
	  since error bounds derived from the error between the fixed-point roots and 
	  the endpoints of the optimal residence time intervals shows relatively small 
	  differences from each other. The use of IA to simulate a range of parameter 
	  states in the system was successful since the percent uncertainties yielded 
	  interval optimal residence times. As a result, IA allows the ecologist to 
	  vary parameters of the model within certain limitations established by
	  stability analysis and obtain a range of optimal residence times a forager
	  might choose. The percent uncertainty limitations on parameter variation 
	  obtained from the stability analysis are high, which is good since it allows 
	  a large amount of model variability.
	</p>

	<p>
          <i>IA's applications to the foraging model include adding more realism to the
	    model through deterministic variability as well as allowing the ecologist to
	    select which parameters are to be uncertain, their range, or different
	    beginning time intervals</i>. The variability is important due to the
	  stochastic nature of ecological process and IA offers an alternative to 
	  average state approximations.

	  <br />
	  The language used in this project was Matlab version 5.3 with an add-on
	  toolbox called INTLAB programmed by Siegfried Rump (2001). Refer to 
	  <a href="http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/~rump/intlab/index.html">
	    http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/~rump/intlab/index.html</a> for
	  additional information on the INTLAB toolbox. For this paper, the INTLAB toolbox
	  was used to provide interval data structures, implementation of interval
	  arithmetic and interval-valued functions, as well as basic functions for radius,
	  midpoint, and intersection interval functions in Matlab.
