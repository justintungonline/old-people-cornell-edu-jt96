# Interval Analysis and its Applications to Optimization in Behavioural Ecology

Interval Analysis is a means of representing uncertainty by replacing single (fixed-point) values with intervals. In this project, interval analysis is applied to a foraging model in behavioural ecology. The model describes an individual foraging in a collection of continuously renewing resource patches. This model is used to determine the optimal residence time of the forager in a resource patch assuming the forager wants to maximize its rate of resource intake. Before applying interval analysis, fixed-point (non-interval) optimization will be done to serve as a basis. Certain parameters in the mode will then be replaced with intervals and interval-based optimization conducted.

This directory contains Matlab files for the model.
