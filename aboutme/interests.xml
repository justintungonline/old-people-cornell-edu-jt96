      <a name="sports"/><h2>Sports and Health:</h2>
      
      <p>
	Everyone does good with a little <i>exercise</i> and paying attention to general
	health issues. Since my dad was big on sports in high school and being the son 
	of two pharmacists, this section, would not surprise anyone. At school, I have played
	many things from basketball, hockey, to cricket though I have not had the chance to
	try any extreme sports yet or most winter sports or curling for that matter, 
	but I am always willingly to try out new ones, especially before one is 
	"too old" (more like too scared). I enjoy
	the first three sports the most especially during nicer weather and I usually
	the others during wet seasons.

      <a name="read"/><h2>Reading and the Internet</h2>
      
      <p>
	Can you say bookworm? This category is partially due to my hobby of childhood
	reading and surfing the internet using <a 
	  href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and finding stuff or reading the news.
	I enjoy pleasure reading of some academic or fictional 
	(especially historical or science) nature with an
	a large <a href="readinglist.html">reading list</a> I started compiling 
	a few years ago.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The wonderful thing about the internet is the links. These links really put
	the "Hyper Text" in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The power of reading HTML
	is that	the instant something catches your attention, you can click on the link
	and find out more. While this digression may or may not be productive, it sure
	places information before you that you might not normally discover while reading
	linear print material.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	One of my old pastimes was reading about history (specifically European history
	and especially the Roman era of 800 B.C. to 1453 A.D.). I actually discovered this
	interest in history from a computer game called Civilization.  Occasionally,
	I also like to read about anything I can find while flipping through an A-Z 
	encyclopedia (a light one preferably - like <a 
	  href="http://www.worldbook.com/">World Book</a>). This pastime might sound 
	"bookwormish" but I think there's a lot of interesting things in encyclopedias you
	might not otherwise encounter unless your a person of wide knowledge (e.g. I 
	learned much the geography of the world through encyclopedias). As you can see, I 
	like bumping into interesting information, as supposed to just linearly reading
	about a topic. Unfortunately, 
	I usually forget stuff shortly after I read it unless I really try to commit to 
	memory. Sometimes I read something in a book or magazine and want to find
	out more about it and the internet is the perfect source for that or when you need
	help such as maps, information stored in database formats, language translations,
	literature searches, information about other countries, etc.

      <a name="cook"/><h2>Cooking:</h2>
      
      <p>
	Ok... so cooking is not really one of my main hobbies, but I am interested in
	it! I mean, you have to eat right? Besides, I think in the near future I will
	have the opportunity to really live this interest out. Due to my experience,
	I mainly center around baking, boiling, and frying pan prepared
	foods with a bent towards chinese stir frys and basic Western-Chinese hybrid 
	dishes.

      <a name="music"/><h2>Music and Movies:</h2>

      <p>
	In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, with a selection of religious
	and classical pieces. In the past, I have been in several choirs and have had a
	strong choral experience as a result. I have had significant musical instruction in the
	harp (around 4.5 years which I learned after 3 years of piano lessons). 
	Ever since I was little,
	I listened to classical music because of the influence of my parents, but gradually
	I got into dance music and from there listened to all sorts of different kinds of
	music from rock, pop, to alternative. I would have to say my all time favourite
	genre is dance type tracks though I find Chinese music is very culturally 
	"fulfilling" at times.
      </p>
      <p>
	Like most people, I like watching movies with my friends. 
	Mainly the standard action/adventure ones, summer releases,
	science-fiction/fantasy, historical, and mystery films are quite good
	too. I have mixed feelings with most horror and drama/epic movies. While
	some of these movie are great and mixed with some of the above categories,
	some of them can be quite bad or boring. That being said, I enjoy the 
	<i>occasional</i>
	crime, animation, and romance (especially if it is more of a comedy) movie.

      <a name="games"/><h2>Games:</h2>
	
      <p>
	As far back as I remember I have played all sorts of games from cards
	board games, and especially computer ones. I never bought a console game system
	before, but I have enjoyed playing Sega, Nintendo, and the Sony series with
	friends. I have played all sorts of computer games and I enjoy mainly strategy
	ones, though action, adventure, and roleplaying games are fun as well. 
	Although nowadays there isn't much time, I still enjoy checking out the latest
	graphics and game concepts and seeing what new things I can learn from games.
