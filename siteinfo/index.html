	  <b>Who are you and what do you do?</b>
<br />
	  I kindly motion you to review the "<a href="../aboutme/index.html">all about justin</a>"
	  section that gives you all I would like to share with people on the internet.
	  As for doing, I work in the Information Technology industry with experience
	  in software engineering, system administration, and security.
	</p>
	
	<a name="basite" />
	<p>
	  <b>What is this site about and what or who is Artemis?</b>
<br />
	  Simply put, this site is my (justin's) personal website and the name of the
	  website is Artemis. The "artemis v.x" in the upper right corner just stands as a 
	  namesake for the website and v.x is the version number just to track significant
	  changes to the website (similar to a program). The
	  image of the statue in the upper left corner is of
	  <a href="http://www.loggia.com/myth/artemis.html">
	    Artemis the ancient Greek goddess</a>.
	</p>

	<a name="whyart" />
	<p>
	  <b>Why is Artemis the name of the website?</b>
<br />
	  This question harder to answer than the other ones. If you are familiar with
	  Greek mythology you will know Artemis (not to be confused with the slightly
	  different Roman goddess Diana) was a protectress of children, lover of nature 
	  and the hunt, and most importantly a free and independent goddess.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I choose her name to name the site since my homepage is initially started
	  as a free-spirited, independent attempt to place my favourites onto a 
	  webpage I could use to explore the <i>natural environment</i> of the internet.
	  Also, I admit I like many things of nature and this site is somewhat decidicated to
	  looking for information on the net and looking for information is similar to hunting. 
	  Since Artemis was a hunter and lover of nature, for these reasons and
	  the fact that I like the name and the personality of the goddess in 
	  the Greek myths made me choose Artemis.
	</p>

	<a name="history" />
	<p>
	  <b>Why did you make this website?</b>
<br />
	  The idea of a homepage really started in the summer of 2000 when I 
	  first worked on a computer at work that was not my own. I was faced with the 
	  problem of exporting my internet bookmarks to that computer and at the time
	  I was not that computer savy and worked on a Linux system, while my
	  computer at home was a Windows PC.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I decided it would be great if I could see my favourites on any computer
	  that I used and decided this idea would be a good excuse to make a personal
	  webpage. At the time, my exposure to HTML was small aside from a school project 
	  to make a fictional website. Nevertheless, I persevered and as you can see
	  have come a long way and that should encourage anyone that making a simple website
	  is not too difficult.
	</p>

	<a name="useful" />
	<p>
	  <b>What is the website useful for, what is around here?</b>
<br />
	  The webpage is useful since it contains:
	  <ol>
	    <li>A demonstration of various web technologies used to make a 
	      simple personal web space. See the <a href="support.html">support</a>
	      page for more details.
	    </li>
	    <li>A <a href="../explore/links.html">portal</a> to the internet that is 
	      comprised of many of the favourites I have bookmarked throughout the
	      year.</li>
	    <li>Academic essays, research, and project <a href="../resources/index.html">resources</a> from work I have
	      done in the past.</li>
	    <li>
<b>Infinite space</b> (ok... well relatively infinite) for expansion
	      and distribution of information, because that is what the internet
	      is almost all about - <i>communication of information</i>.</li>
	    <li>My own information for record keeping that may be of varying degrees
	      of use for other internet users.</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you like computers or any topics in the 
	  <a href="../explore/links.html">web gateway</a>,
	  you will find the links useful. You can see an overview of
	  the categories of links via the <a href="sitemap.html">sitemap</a>
	  page.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The content in the website is largely useful for my
	  own records as well as paving the way for future information
	  that I would like to publish on the web. So far my resources (e.g.
	  articles) should be helpful to some people and maybe
	  you might just learn something while browsing through the site.
	  I know I have learned much just looking through other people's
	  websites.
        </p>

	<a name="desmake" />
	<p>
	  <b>How did you make this website and/or design it?</b>
<br />
	  I am <b>not</b> an very creative person (and some might think
	  not even mildly creative) but I am good at research and learning
	  and therefore I took a fair amount of time analyzing the <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
	  specifications for data and online presentation and looking at other people's
	  webpages on the net from professional, corporate, community, to
	  personal webpages. Even when I am not actively looking for a design,
	  I always note down pages that I thought were particularly interesting.
	  One of the best ways <i>to learn and sometimes do HTML is to look
	    at the source of other people's webpages</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  My structural design therefore closely resembles other
	  people's personal websites with my personal touch being felt in simplicity, 
	  actual content, and in minor text and structuring styles. My
	  very first website was made in notepad and I later constructed a 
	  20 page personal website through <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/">Frontpage</a>
	  which is excellent for home users who want speed and a decent looking website.
	  Due to my computer science background, for this third overhaul (artemis),
	  I made some choices involving hand coding in XML (e<b>X</b>tensible <b>M</b>arkup
	  <b>L</b>anguage). For more details, see the <a href="support.html">site support</a> page.
